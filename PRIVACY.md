# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 13, 2026

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy applies to the **Awesome Copilot Guide** demo application. **I** created this project specifically as a demonstration entry for the following DEV.to contests:

- [Algolia Agent Studio Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/algolia-2026-01-07)
- [GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/github-2026-01-21)

By using this demo, you acknowledge that it is an open-source project intended for educational and demonstration purposes.

## 2. Transparency and Open Source

**I** believe in full transparency. This application is open source, and you can inspect the exact code running this site to verify how your data is handled.

## 3. Information I Collect

**I do not personally host or archive your data.**
The application functions as a pass-through interface. **I** do not maintain a private database of users or permanent logs on my own personal servers. However, the third-party services listed below _do_ store conversation history and technical data as part of their functionality.

## 4. Third-Party Services and Data Processing

To provide the hosting and AI chat functionality, this application relies on the following third-party services. Your data is processed by them according to their respective policies:

### A. Algolia (Agent Studio)

The chat infrastructure is powered by **Algolia Agent Studio**.

- **Role:** Chat backend and processor.
- **Data Storage:** Algolia stores conversation logs which are accessible to me via the Algolia Dashboard.

### B. Google (Gemini API / Google AI Studio)

The AI responses are generated using **Google Gemini** models via **Google AI Studio** (Free Tier).

- **Role:** LLM (Large Language Model) provider.
- **Important Warning:** Data sent to the Google AI Studio free tier **may be used by Google to train their models**.

## 5. Data Retention and Deletion Limitations

- **Temporary Demo:** This application is a temporary demonstration for the duration of the DEV.to contests.
- **My Deletion Commitment:** Upon the conclusion of the contests and the announcement of the winners, **I** will manually trigger the deletion of all conversation logs accessible to me within the Algolia Dashboard.
- **Limitation:** Please note that while I can trigger the "delete" action in the dashboard, **the actual permanent purging of data from Algolia's backups or internal systems is governed by Algolia's own data retention policies and is outside of my technical control.**
